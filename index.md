### How to represent the ongoing changes of our planet? How can we develop new modes of writing to help us understand our world? How to articulate centuries of graphic skills and human knowledge with the practice of data?

<br />
<br />

#### Micro Meso Macro is a two-days event to gather scientists from multiple disciplines (earth sciences, social sciences, life sciences, computer and data science), designers, architects and artists to present and discuss different approaches of representing data.
