### How to represent the ongoing changes of our planet? How can we develop new modes of writing to help us understand our world? How to articulate centuries of graphic skills and human knowledge with the practice of data?

<br />
<br />

#### Micro Meso Macro is a two-days event that gather scientists from multiple disciplines (earth sciences, social sciences, life sciences, computer science, data science, etc.) with designers, architects and artists to present and exchange their practices and representations of data.
