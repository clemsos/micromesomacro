### How to represent the ongoing changes of our planet? How can we develop new modes of writing to help us understand our world? How to articulate centuries of graphic skills and human knowledge with recent practices of data?

<br />
<br />

#### *Micro Meso Macro* is a two-days event that gathers scientists from multiple disciplines (earth sciences, social sciences, life sciences, computer science, data science, etc.) with designers, architects and artists to exchange about their visual practices of data.

#### As is name suggests, *Micro Meso Macro* investigates the multiple scales of life. Time, geography, networks, relationships, quantities... : they come in all sizes and shapes. This event provides an account of works and reflections that have used data to visually explore different dimensions of reality.

#### We believe that our goal in discussing visualisation should not be to seek an unified approach to writing, but to support a diverse set of possibilities, tools and authoring styles. The visual grammar of data still in the making. There still is important explorations to be conducted in the domain of representation to invent news mental models, develop new tools, create new ways of observing. We hope this event will provide a space to discuss them.
