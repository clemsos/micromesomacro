How to represent the ongoing changes of our planet? How can we develop new modes of writing and visualising to help us understand our world? How to articulate centuries of graphic skills and knowledge in new practices of data?

During two day, scientists from multiple disciplines (earth sciences, social sciences, life sciences, computer and data science), designers, architects and artists will gather at ENS de Lyon to present and discuss different approaches of representing data. Workshops, talks and panels will help us explore practices, technics and theory of visual culture of data.

The two day are free, open to all audiences, including students outside ENS.
