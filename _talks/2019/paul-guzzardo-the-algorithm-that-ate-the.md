 "The Algorithm that Ate The Street" proposes a street tool. A tool to help see, map, and maybe act. The tool is tagged “The Digital Street Lab in a Box” (DSLB). It is a hammer and a triage system, a Patrick Geddes - Hannah Arendt mashup. It’s a hammer in the face of weaponized data, those predictive machines whose goal is to create a perfect model of who you are, what you want, and what you’re going to do. And it’s triage gear, kit to keep us _ the half-seeing _ standing in the face of an unceasing data assault.
