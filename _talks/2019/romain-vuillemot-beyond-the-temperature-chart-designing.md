 This is a meta-talk where I'll review dataviz related to climate change, and organize them to identify design dimensions. Hopefully this talk will be a call to action for (even more) impactful effort in this hot topic, beyond temperature charts, for concrete actions to reduce human footprints inducing climate change.
