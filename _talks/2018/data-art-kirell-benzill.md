speaker: "Dr Kirell Benzi"
bio: "Kirell Benzi holds a Ph.D. in Data Science from EFPL (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) where he teaches data visualization to over 180 master’s students. Through a hypnotic visual semantic, Kirell works to show that algorithms have a soul… In other words, that we can generate emotion and curiosity through calculations. Even though this logic can seem cold in the collective imagination, it might be able to seduce even the most averse to science. His work has been shown on over 100 websites in 10 languages, he also runs or takes part in several art exhibitions around the globe."
