### Micro Meso Macro is a book/catalogue featuring all the graphics/artworks and reflections introduced during the [Micro Meso Macro](http://micromesomacro.com) event in Lyon.

<br>
> We believe that our goal in discussing visualisation should not be to seek an unified approach to writing, but to support a diverse set of possibilities, tools and authoring styles. The visual grammar of data still in the making. Important explorations still to be conducted in the domain of representation to invent new mental models, develop new tools, create new ways of observing.

Excerpt quote from the [original website](http://micromesomacro.com).

### The book

#### Micro Meso Macro gathers scientists from multiple disciplines (earth sciences, social sciences, life sciences, computer science, data science, etc.) with designers, architects and artists to exchange about their visual practices of data.

#### As its name suggests, Micro Meso Macro investigates the multiple scales of life. Time, geography, networks, relationships, quantities… : they come in all sizes and shapes. This book provides an account of works and reflections that have used data to visually explore different dimensions of reality.
